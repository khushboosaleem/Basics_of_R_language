If you have jupyter notebook so install 
R by using this link: https://cran.r-project.org/
and go to the Rstudio and then install this package by using this command:
install.packages('IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)



and then create jupyter notebook so you see R install in jupyter notebook.
